This library provides some personal implementations of IO features in Java. This library may grow depending on personal needs, but if you think that a highly generic method should be provided by this lib, do not hesitate to open an issue.

It was first made for the purpose of providing a constraint-free library of some common features provided by Apache Commons-IO and other similar libraries. Dealing with licenses, even Open Source ones, is just a pain in the ass because you never know what you can actually do in your specific context without asking to lawyers (and on some topics they do not even agree with each other). Even the most simple and broadly used ones require you some ego-centric conditions like keeping the license/notice file or any other thing that you may just completely ignore. This library is licensed under CC0, which withdraws as much requirements as the law permit. So if there is something you must/cannot do with this lib, you must/cannot do it with any other lib, whatever the license it uses.
